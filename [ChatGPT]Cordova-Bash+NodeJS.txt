Yes, a Cordova app can run Bash and NodeJS modules on Android, but it requires some additional configuration. By default, Cordova only supports running JavaScript code in the app, but it is possible to use plugins to execute native code or shell commands.

To run Bash scripts, you can use the cordova-plugin-shell-exec plugin, which allows you to execute shell commands from within a Cordova app. To use this plugin, you need to install it with the cordova plugin add command, and then you can call its functions from your JavaScript code.

To run NodeJS modules, you can use the cordova-plugin-nodejs plugin, which embeds a NodeJS runtime into the app and allows you to execute NodeJS code. This plugin requires some additional configuration to bundle your NodeJS code with the app and set up the runtime environment.

It's worth noting that executing native code or shell commands in a Cordova app can introduce security risks and should be done carefully. It's also important to consider the performance implications of running these types of code in a mobile app.

Cordova can execute shell commands on Android, including Bash commands. Therefore, it is possible to write a Cordova app that integrates with Termux, as Termux provides a Bash terminal for Android devices. You can use Cordova's Child Process plugin to execute shell commands from within the app, and use the Termux API to interact with Termux, such as running scripts or accessing files.

To install the Cordova Child Process plugin, you can use the following command:
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-child-process

After installing the plugin, you can use the cordova.plugins.childProcess object to execute Bash commands in your Cordova app.

Here's an example of how to use the plugin to run a Bash command:
cordova.plugins.childProcess.exec('ls -la', function(err, stdout, stderr) {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error: ', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('Output: ', stdout);
});

This example runs the ls -la command and logs the output to the console.

Note that this plugin only works on Android and iOS platforms. If you want to use it on other platforms, you will need to add platform-specific implementations.
